list --> (contains current equation)

[user input] --> [equation list]

  * create a sorting algorithm?




[input number] --> [appends "currentEquation.currentNumber"]

[input symbol] --> [push number --> equation] --> [push symbol --> equation] --> [clears currnet number]

NEEDS A SOLVING ORDER FOR NEXT PART

[input left parentheses] --> [put a marker in "currentEquation" list] --> [start input to "currentParethese" list] --> 
[records equation to var 'paraEquation#'] --> [equation is to be solved BEFORE main equation] --> 
[Input right parentheses] --> [begin recording back to "currentEquation"]


the marker could be something like p1, p2, p3, ect...



[input SOLVE] --> [Sorting function finds if there are parenteses equations] -->
[looks for if there is a number before or a symbol] --> [solves the parentheses] --> 
[multiplies solution by number outside of parenteses] --> [replaces symbol with desegnated solution] -->
[solve the equation like normal]

made it so that the object foir parentheses has a use and worked on making the solve and sort parenthese functions work alongside the normal 
sort and solve functions... having alot of trouble getting the sort function for the parentheses to actually work

got the function for the right parenthese to actually work and store the equation into the allEquations array.
it doesent seem to be sorting the allEquations array in the way that i need it to so it never ends up solving anything.

Finally got the sortParentheses function to work by changing the parenthesesCountervarriably at line 49 from 0 to -1 so that it would actually be
sorting the right thing and not have any errors.

got the sorting shit to work and successfully sort and solve the equations and whenever it comes across a left parenthese
it 

for some reason now whenever it has the left parenthese symbol in the currentEquation.equation array it adds a space before the parenthese

thoughts...
